# Jetson-Charger-Cluster---Next-Gen

The Jetson Charger Cluster-Next Gen (JCC) is a hybrid team composed of Computer Engineering students: Jordan Thomas, William Bullard, Satyo Wasistho,
Michael Oâ€™Dell, Karson Knoll, and Cybersecurity Engineer: Svetlana Freeman. The goal of this project is to create a relatively powerful and inexpensive high performance computer
capable of parallel computing made from off the shelf components. The purpose of this computing machine is so that students who take CPE 412/512 have access to an up to
date parallel computing machine that they can access on their own time, is inexpensive for the department to maintain, and allows students to experiment with node 
control and how to optimally run their programs in a parallel computing environment. Something they do not get with the current class setup of them just using the 
Alabama Supercomputer. It automizes the programs and their execution for them, cutting out an important part of their parallel computing education. Our solution, a 
Beowulf style cluster made with 5 Jetson 2GB development boards, a left over switch the school had in a storage room that was not in use, open source software, and an 
inexpensive 3D printed case. All of which by the end of this project will come in well below our possible competitors prices. We will also have a cybersecurity risk 
management/mitigation plan in effect to insure that we do not add any undue risk to the school and its resources.
